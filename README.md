ZeroList is a revolutionary to-do app that helps you end each day with nothing left to do.

Rather than complicated tags and due dates and lists that never end, ZeroList aims to help you make and finish a list on a daily basis. Working on a bigger project? ZeroList will help you break it up into daily goals.

Have a massive project or huge agenda with multiple collaborators and necessary tags and file uploads? Use something else. :)

## Screenshots & Videos
Who needs these when the beta development version is live?

## Stuff for Nerds

The current version is a prototype based on VueJS webpack, material design styling, and a few open source NodeJS plugins. Back-end is currently Firebase. Additional functionality to move it from a development version to a full assistive to-do app is in the works for a launch this year!

## Want to try it on your own?

Check out the zerolist-beta folder and its README! A limited (without premium features) open-source version with commented code will be available when the full developed version launches.
